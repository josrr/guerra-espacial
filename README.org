Spacewar! was conceived in 1961 by Martin Graetz, Stephen Russell, and Wayne
Wiitanen. It was first realized on the PDP-1 in 1962 by Stephen Russell, Peter
Samson, Dan Edwards, and Martin Graetz, together with Alan Kotok, Steve Piner,
and Robert A Saunders. Spacewar! is in the public domain, but this credit
paragraph must accompany all distributed versions of the program.
